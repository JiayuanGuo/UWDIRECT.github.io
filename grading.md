There will be X homeworks, each worth X points.
The homeworks will be assigned in the first part of the course and students will submit
their homework using GitHub. **You must have created a GitHub account before class starts.**
To receive full credit, homework must be posted by midnight Pacific Time on the due date.
Unless otherwise stated otherwise, homework is due on X.
Two points will be deducted from homework received up to a week after its due date.
No credit will be given for homework more than one week late (unless there is special permission
from the instructors).
All homework, including those with extensions, must be submitted no later than midnight X, 2017.


## Class Participation

Class participation will be graded based on project related presentations, e.g.
stand ups, technology reviews and project summaries.

## Course Project

Projects will be graded based on:
- the poster presentation
- documentation (especially function and design specifications)
- the features implemented
- code quality

Grades for the project will be assigned to the entire team, although
there will be adjustments for significant discrepancies in the relative 
contributions of team members.  The latter will be assessed by commit 
logs and by a peer assesment survey students will take at the end of the quarter.
Projects are due by midnight X, 2017.
